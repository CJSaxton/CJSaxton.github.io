### Rotating thermal convection under generalised quasilinear approximations
We model rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection in 3D direct numerical simulations of a periodic box with Boussinesq perturbations, subject to inclined global rotation. Vertical boundary temperatures are fixed locally, with a linear meridional gradient (Ty).  We vary Ty and convective driving. Emergent flows can include thermal winds, anisotropic turbulence, and giant vortices. Fully nonlinear (NL) runs provide benchmarks for testing quasilinear (QL) and general quasilinear (GQL) approximate dynamics. In horizontal planes, each variable (q) splits into a Fourier “low” background (qL) at |kx|,|ky|<Λ, and a “high” variable for fluctuations (qH). Varying the GQL cutoff (Λ=∞,10,5,1,0) selectively impairs spectral power transfers, affecting flow morphologies, entropy, variability, local and global statistics. Versions of GQL usually improve upon the accuracy of QL (Λ=0), but low-Λ can produce spurious inverse cascades.  Higher Λ improves realism more readily for models with stronger thermal winds.  GQL succeeds generally even in peculiar cases that never settle to one unimodal steady state.  Accuracy depends on the directness of boundary conditions, simple vertical profiles, and raising Λ to enclose the most active Fourier modes.  However, spatial anisotropies are Λ-sensitive in all our tests.
