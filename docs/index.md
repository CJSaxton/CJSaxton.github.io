We model rotating Rayleigh–Bénard convection in 3D direct numerical simulations
of a periodic box with Boussinesq perturbations,
subject to inclined global rotation.
Vertical boundary temperatures are fixed locally, with a linear meridional gradient (T<sub>y</sub>).
We vary T<sub>y</sub> and convective driving.
Emergent flows can include thermal winds, anisotropic turbulence, and giant vortices.
Fully nonlinear (NL) runs provide benchmarks for testing quasilinear (QL) and general quasilinear (GQL) approximate dynamics.
In horizontal planes, each variable (*q*) splits into a Fourier “low” background (*q*<sub>L</sub>)
at \|*k<sub>x</sub>*\|,\|*k<sub>y</sub>*\|<*Λ*,
and a “high” variable for fluctuations (*q*<sub>H</sub>).
Varying the GQL cutoff (*Λ*=∞,10,5,1,0) selectively impairs spectral power transfers,
affecting flow morphologies, entropy, variability, local and global statistics.
Versions of GQL usually improve upon the accuracy of QL (*Λ*=0), but low-*Λ* can produce spurious inverse cascades.
Higher *Λ* improves realism more readily for models with stronger thermal winds.
GQL succeeds generally even in peculiar cases that never settle to one unimodal steady state.
Accuracy depends on the directness of boundary conditions, simple vertical profiles, 
and raising *Λ* to enclose the most active Fourier modes.
However, spatial anisotropies are *Λ*-sensitive in all our tests.

Information entropy measures the disorder or inherent difficulty of predicting spatial and temporal structures
in a time-series or spatially in a high-dimensional dynamical system.
Statistical complexity characterises departures from equilibrium distributions (even given a fixed entropy),
and can distinguish deterministic from stochastic physics (chaos vs noise).
Related measures of causality quantify the relative influence of time-irreversible and 
-reversible processes (or directionality spatially).
Calculating these scores from direct numerical simulations can characterise the importance of coherent structures or turbulent transitions.
It is also interesting to compare the scores for physically equivalent models calculated via approximate methods
(e.g. generalised quasilinear models or data-driven codes).
The entropic cost of any approximation scheme is objectively derivable.
We consider diverse applications to
(e.g.) fluid thermal convection,
magneto-rotational turbulence,
and gyrokinetic plasma turbulence.
